GPTT PATCHES

A collection of some patches for the Kerbal Space Program mod Gradual Progression Tech Tree.

To install, drag into the "additional patches" folder in zzGPTT.

Personal balance patches are for those who want a bit more of historical progression with some of the BDB parts specifically. Really just shifts around some of the cameras, the Ranger Seismic Probe, and a couple engines.
